The Marietta Country Club has asked you to write a program to gather, then display the results of the golf tournament played at the end of March. The Club president Mr. Martin has asked you to write two programs. <br>
The first program will accept as input each player''s first name, last name, and golf score and then for each player, save this data in a file named golf.txt. Please note, there are 16 players in the tournament so you will need to save data for 16 different players in the text file. <br>
The second program will read the data for each player from the golf.txt file and display them with appropriate headings above the data being displayed. Additionally, the second program will determine and mark each player as being either over, under, or at par. <br>
If the score is = Par, then display 'Made Par' <br>
If the score is < Par, then display 'Under Par' <br>
If the score is > Par, then display 'Over Par' <br><br>
There are 16 players in the tournament. Par for the course is 80. The data is as follows: <br>
Andrew Marks 72 <br>
Betty Franks 89 <br>
Connie William 92 <br>
Donny Ventura 78 <br>
